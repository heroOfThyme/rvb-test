## Client Overview

**Legacy Exteriors Inc** is a Windsor, Ontario-based landscaping company specializing in high-quality home services, including sod installation, driveway services, drainage solutions, and trenching. Founded in 2022 by Alex Orton, a skilled and dedicated handyman, the company has quickly gained a reputation for excellence within the local community. Alex’s commitment to craftsmanship and customer satisfaction has earned him glowing reviews and a loyal client base.

Initially, Legacy Exteriors operated with a basic Wix website—a practical solution for businesses in their early stages. However, as the company grew, the limitations of a DIY platform became apparent. To support their expansion and establish a stronger online presence, Legacy Exteriors sought a professional partner to elevate their digital strategy. That’s where **RVB Data Sciences Corp** stepped in.

## Project Overview
Legacy Exteriors approached RVB Data Sciences Corp with a clear goal: to modernize and expand their digital footprint. While they had an existing website and a Google Business profile, these assets lacked the structure and optimization needed to drive meaningful results. To address this, we developed a comprehensive plan that included:

- **A newly designed website** to serve as the foundation for their online presence.
- **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** to improve visibility in local search results.
- **A blog hub** to share valuable content and engage their audience.
- **A Google Ads campaign** to target the local Windsor market.
- **Optimization of their Google Business profile** to enhance credibility and local search performance.

This multi-faceted approach ensured that Legacy Exteriors could attract, engage, and convert potential customers effectively.

The Google Ads campaign began with a steady start, quickly gaining traction as traffic surged to the website. During this initial phase, Legacy Exteriors started receiving calls directly from the ads and their website, marking a promising beginning. However, after the initial surge, we noticed a period of stagnation. By adjusting the campaign strategy, we achieved another significant increase in traffic. This second wave of success was so impactful that Legacy Exteriors decided to **end the campaign early**—they were fully booked and ready to focus on delivering exceptional service to their new clients.
