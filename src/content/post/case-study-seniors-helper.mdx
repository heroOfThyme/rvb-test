## Client Overview

Seniors Helper is an independent business in Burlington, Ontario, providing personalized cleaning services for seniors’ homes. Operated by Donna Irving, the company is dedicated to helping seniors maintain a clean, safe, and comfortable living environment. Donna’s warm personality and attention to detail have earned her a loyal client base.

Before working with RVB Data Sciences, Seniors Helper relied on word-of-mouth referrals and local advertising. While these methods worked, Donna wanted a **simple**, **professional** online presence to serve as a landing page for potential clients. She needed a website that reflected her personality, showcased her services, and made it easy for clients to contact her.
