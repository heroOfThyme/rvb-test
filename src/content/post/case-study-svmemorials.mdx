## Client Overview

S&V Memorials is a family-owned business based in Windsor, Ontario, specializing in crafting custom headstones and memorials. Founded by Slavko Vidakovic, the company has been serving families in the Windsor-Essex region for over a decade. Known for their attention to detail and compassionate service, S&V Memorials helps families honor their loved ones with beautiful, lasting tributes.

Before partnering with RVB Data Sciences, S&V Memorials relied on word-of-mouth referrals and local advertising. While these methods were effective, they lacked the **control** and **reach** of a professional online presence. With a website, S&V Memorials could showcase their craftsmanship, share their story, and connect with families during their time of need.

## Project Overview

S&V Memorials approached RVB Data Sciences with a clear goal: to create a website that reflects their dedication to quality and compassion. They needed a platform to showcase their portfolio, provide information about their services, and make it easy for clients to contact them.

To achieve this, we developed a comprehensive plan that included:

- A **newly designed website** to serve as their digital storefront.
- **Web hosting solutions** to ensure their site was secure and always accessible.

## Services Provided
To meet S&V Memorials’ needs, we provided the following services:

- [Web Development Services](/web-development): A custom-designed website built for scalability and performance.
- [Web Hosting Solutions](/web-hosting): Secure, reliable hosting with a 99.9% uptime guarantee.

## Key Features Implemented

One of the standout features requested by S&V Memorials was a **portfolio gallery** to showcase their work. We designed a fully customizable gallery that allows them to:

- Display high-quality images of their memorials.
- Organize their work by category (e.g., headstones, plaques, benches).
- Add new projects easily as they complete them.

We also integrated a **contact form** and **service request feature**, making it simple for clients to reach out and inquire about their services.

## Client Testimonial
Collaborating with S&V Memorials was a truly meaningful experience.  We are very thankful to have earned a nice review from them.
